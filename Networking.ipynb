        "  2. Data Link Layer\n",
        "    * Responsible for node-to-node data transfer and error detection.\n",

        "- DNS (Domain Name System) is like the phonebook of the internet. It translates human-readable domain names (like google.com) into IP addresses (like 142.250.183.174) that computers use to find each other on a network.\n",
        "\n",
        "  ---\n",
        "  #### How DNS Resolves Domain Names\n",
        "  1. The process is called DNS Resolution, and it happens in steps:\n",
        "  User Enters Domain Name\n",
        "    * You type google.com into your browser.\n",
        "  2. Check Local Cache\n",
        "    * Your computer first checks if it already knows the IP from its memory (DNS cache).\n",
        "  3. Ask Recursive DNS Resolver\n",
        "    * If not cached, the request goes to a recursive resolver (usually from your ISP or Google DNS like 8.8.8.8).\n",
        "  4. Contact Root Name Server\n",
        "    * The resolver asks a root server where to find the .com domain’s information.\n",
        "  5. Contact TLD Name Server\n",
        "    * The resolver then asks a TLD server (Top-Level Domain server) for .com where the domain’s authoritative server is.\n",
        "  6. Contact Authoritative Name Server\n",
        "    * This server holds the actual IP address for google.com and sends it back.\n",
        "  7. Return IP Address to Browser\n",
        "    * The IP is sent to your browser, which then connects to Google’s server.\n",

        "### 5. Provide a brief description of the HTTP request and response model along with an illustrative diagram.\n",
        "- HTTP Request and Response Model\n",
        "\n",
        "  The HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) request–response model is how communication happens between a client (like a web browser) and a server (like a website’s backend).\n",
        "\n",
        "  ---\n",
        "  1. HTTP Request (Client → Server)\n",
        "    The client sends a request to the server asking for a resource (like an HTML page, image, or API data).\n",
        "\n",
        "    The request contains:\n",
        "      * Method → GET, POST, PUT, DELETE (type of action).\n",
        "      * URL → Location of the resource.\n",
        "      * Headers → Extra info like browser type, content type.\n",
        "      * Body → Data sent (mainly in POST/PUT requests).\n",
        "\n",
        "  2. HTTP Response (Server → Client)\n",
        "    The server processes the request and sends a response back.\n",
        "    The response contains:\n",
        "      * Status Code → 200 OK, 404 Not Found, 500 Server Error.\n",
        "      * Headers → Info like content type, length, caching rules.\n",
        "      * Body → Actual resource (HTML, JSON, image, etc.).\n",
        "\n",
        "  Simple Example:\n",
        "  * You type https://example.com in your browser.\n",
        "  * Browser sends an HTTP GET request for the homepage.\n",
        "  * Server responds with status code 200 and the HTML file of the page.\n",

        "### 6. What is CORS? Explain its purpose and why developers frequently encounter CORS errors during development.\n",
        "- CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) is a security feature in web browsers that controls whether a web page from one domain can request resources (like APIs) from another domain.\n",
        "\n",
        "  ---\n",
        "  Purpose of CORS\n",
        "  - To protect users by preventing malicious websites from making unauthorized requests to other sites on behalf of the user.\n",
        "  - It lets servers specify who is allowed to access their resources using special HTTP headers.\n",
        "\n",
        "  ---\n",
        "  Why Developers Encounter CORS Errors\n",
        "  When a browser blocks a cross-origin request because the server didn’t allow it, you get a CORS error in the console. This is very common in development because:\n",
        "  1. Different Ports or Domains\n",
        "    * Example: Frontend at http://localhost:3000 tries to fetch data from http://localhost:5000 — the browser treats this as different origins.\n",
        "  2. Server Missing CORS Headers\n",
        "    * If the API doesn’t send Access-Control-Allow-Origin in the response, the browser will block it.\n",
        "  3. Restricted HTTP Methods or Headers\n",
        "    * Some requests trigger a preflight OPTIONS request and fail if the server doesn’t allow those methods or headers.\n",
        "\n",
        "  Request\n",
        "    ```\n",
